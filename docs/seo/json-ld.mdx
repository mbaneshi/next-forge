description: How we've implemented JSON-LD for our blog posts
---

We rely on `ArticleJsonLd` component from [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) to generate JSON-LD for blog posts. It's currently wired up to convey the title, description, author, date published, and tags. This is fully validated Google structured data validated JSON-LD markup for the ARTICLE schema markup type and should make your blog posts more likely to be featured in Google Search results.
